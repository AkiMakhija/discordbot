Emotional Response: It listens for messages containing sad or negative words (like “sad,” “angry,” etc.) and responds with a random uplifting message.
Custom Encouragement: Users can add new encouragements with the $new command or delete them using the $del command.
Toggling Response Mode: The bot can toggle its response to sad words on or off using $responding true or $responding false.
